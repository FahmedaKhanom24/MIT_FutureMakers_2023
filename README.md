# MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon – Applied Deep Learning Focus  

The MIT FutureMakers 2023 is a six-week program, co-offered by the MIT RAISE Initiative (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education) in collaboration with SureStart to provide flexible, accessible and industry-skills focused Data, AI and Machine Learning related skill-building programs for emerging technologists. 

The 6-week AI training program is entirely virtual and part time, and begins on July 5th, 2023. The primary goal of the FutureMakers program is to support a diverse community of engaged, high-achieving, and ambitious tech and AI-career aspirants in developing their understanding of the AI ecosystem, building applied technical skills in machine learning and related technologies, along with "power" skills critical for career success through a modular program led by proximate technical mentors and supported by experts from industry and academia.

As a FutureMakers participant, you will learn foundational concepts related to AI, get hands-on experience developing machine learning models, and practice using your skills to build AI solutions for real-world problems, using the a collaborative learning approach in a mentoring-centered environment. The 6-weeks of the program will have two Program Phases: the AI Training Phase and the AI Innovation Phase. The AI Training Phase has specific technical modules you will work on. The AI Innovation Phase is independent group work on your Capstone Project. During the AI Innovation phase, using an Entreprenuerial Process, you will identify ONE socially-impactful real-world problem, and develop an innovative solution that addresses the selected real-world problem with your newly-learned AI, ML and data skills, with a commitment towards ethical AI.  


The modules you will encounter in Phase 1 are laid out in the following grid. Their descriptions as well as recommendations for Phase 2 are presented below the grid.  __We recommend reading through this entire ReadMe before going to the specific modules.__

## Program Phase 1: The Tech Training Phase

The first phase of the MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon is the AI Technical Training phase. This phase is a self-paced learning phase, in which students working in a team-based learning environment, supported by SureStart mentors, complete technical modules focused on building foundational AI knowledge and hands-on Machine Learning skills. Besides support from technically-trained proximate mentors, participants will also receive advice, tips and recommendations for experienced academics and industry experts through our Career Pathways seminar series.

The modules are as follows:

__Module 00 Pre-program 1__: We start with a review of python fundamentals including I/O, data types, data structures, logical loops, exception handling and file I/O.

__Module 00 Pre-program 2__: Continuing the exploration of python fundamentals, we lightly review some object oriented programming concepts with python, and handling of packages/modules/libraries and debugging errors and exceptions. 

__Module 1__: We introduce Numpy, a staple library for data manipulation, in this module. Specifically, we learn how to make numpy arrays and matrices, and operations we can do on them.

__Module 2__: Working with tabular data is easier with the Pandas library. Hence we look at exploring data using Pandas in this module. 

__Module 3__: We continue Phase 1 with an introduction to machine learning algorithms, and how prebuilt Python libraries makes it easy and fun to run machine learning (ML) models for Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

__Module 4__: Having had a general introduction to ML through simpler machine learning models, we will now jump into Deep Learning, a more powerful ML modeling approach. We will also get an introduction to Tensorflow, one of the main Python libraries used for building deep neural networks easily and quickly. 

__Module 5__: There exist many Python libraries that make it easy and efficient for us to build complex neural networks. However, these libraries create bit of a "blackbox" around their internal workings of how these networks are actually put together. So, today, with a goal to remove the "blackbox", we will build a simple neural network from scratch, and study the various aspects of these networks step-by-step over the next few modules.

__Module 6__: Going one step further with neural network architectures, we explore a widely used deep architecture called Convolutional Neural Networks (or CNNs). CNNs are known for their ability to compound smaller patterns into larger more human-recognizable ones. CNNs are often used for Computer Vision related modeling tasks.

__Module 7__: An important part of the learning process of any machine learning algorithm is its loss function (or cost function). It maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number, intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the event. We start by studying loss functions related to regression-related models.

__Module 8__: Today, we will discuss loss in the context of classification-related algorithms. Classification loss differ from regression loss; regression loss functions aim at predicting quantities while classificaiton loss functions aim at predicting class and labels.

__Module 9__: This module on optimization is very connected to the previous two modules on loss. We can have a loss (or cost) function that represents how accurate a given machine learning model is at the prediction task, but we also need another algorithm that is able to change the weights of the model to lower the loss/cost function, such that the associated model gets better at the prediction task. Such algorithms are referred to as "optimizers", which we will study in this module. 

__Module 10__: If we just consider the perceptrons/nodes, all neural networks are still very linear in their function. But to model complex real-world data, we need to add non-linearity. This is accomplished by adding intermediate nodes that apply non-linear functions called "activation functions" to the outputs of the neural network layer preceding it before it is ingested by the next layer. Today we will explore the various kinds of activation functions.

__Module 11__: Three crucial aspects of any machine learning model are the quality and quantity of data on which it is based, how we train the models, and how long we train the models. Problems with any three of these aspects can result in a model that has not learned enough from the data, or not learned the true patterns in the data and instead glommed onto the wrong details in the data, thus producing sub-optimal predictve outcomes. We learn how to combat such applied problems in this module.

__Module 12__: In this module we continue learning how to handle overfitting and underfitting problems by learning about modifications we can make to our neural network to address them. 

__Module 13__: Given the AI and Machine Learning's growing role in human decision-making and its large implications, today we will consider data ethics, data bias, the negative consequences of failing to make ethical considerations part of the process. We will learn about constructing an Ethical AI Framework to incorporate in our technical development, so that we can build AI, Machine Learning and data-based tech solutions that are inclusive, equitable and fair. 

__Module 14__: An advanced architecture of neural networks is an autoencoder. Unlike the deep models we have discussed thus far, autoencoders are "unsupervised", i.e., these algorithms identify hidden patterns in the input data without the need for human "supervision" in the form of prediction labels (also called "true" labels). In this module, we will examine the network structure of autoencoders that makes it possible for it to learn in an unsupervised manner.

__Module 15__: In this module, we will learn about generative adversarial networks (or GANs), an enhancement to autoencoders. In GANs, we have an encoder-decoder setup: an encoder that is trained to mimic the input data, and an decoder that discerns whether the data it encounters is real or generated by the encoder. The goal of the encoder is to fool the decoder; and the decoder's to catch it. Through tens of thousands of repeated iterations or more, the encoder-decoder pair essentially train each other to get better at their tasks. 

__Module 16__: As a last module in the program, we will explore an interesting application of deep models: style transfer. Style transfer is the process of applying the visual style of one image to another, creating a new image that combines the content of one image with the artistic characteristics of another. Style transfer and generative adversarial networks often discussed together, but they are not the same. The former is a particular task, while the latter is an approach for achieving the task. In this module, we will also clarify such foundational differences, and explore other related sub-topics.

## Program Phase 2: The Tech Innovation Phase
During the Innnovation phase of our Virtual AI intensive (the last 2 weeks), student teams will **identify ONE real-world problem** that is of import and impact in their local and global contexts; **define a Capstone Project** to address the selected real-world problem; and **apply their newly-learned AI, ML and data skills to solve** the problem. Teams will continue to receive guidance and support from mentors in developing and presenting their Innovation projects.

At the very beginning of Phase 2, the Makeathon theme choices will be presented by the program team. Participants will select one of them on which to base their Capstone project. All support materials, forms, and judging rubric and expectations will also be shared. 

Though in this phase individuals and teams have no specific Colab notebooks to work on, here are our recommendations for a modular approach to working on your Capstone project:

__Table stakes__: Attend all three presentations related to the Create-a-thon:

[Introduction to the Create-a-thon](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NW9gu3NbEVnvzPLMyhvqbM_TIFsnsi6bfFnbyj9aQKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

[Using an Entrepreneurial  Process for the Create-a-thon](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NW9gu3NbEVnvzPLMyhvqbM_TIFsnsi6bfFnbyj9aQKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

[Action Plan for Capstone  Project Success](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NW9gu3NbEVnvzPLMyhvqbM_TIFsnsi6bfFnbyj9aQKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

__Inspiration__: Watch some [past program winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9FyCODLflg&list=PLsSCYP2a9mZhAVJLVefDkOskkoW8m_UwH).

__Stage 1__: Identify Create-a-thon theme and share back with SureStart using the appropriate form. Begin brainstorming ideas for a socially meaningful real-world problem that is meaningful to individuals in your team. Each team member should review the [Resources Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11zOHv8EM5P-dwGRONRxml2YriRawT69k/view?usp=sharing). Continue ideating and brainstorming in your teams. Use the  Guide to define roles and tasks for each team member. Every team member must have at least 1 primary task that they are leading, and 1-2 tasks that they are supporting. Set up time to meet with your Business Mentors, if you have not already done so.

__Stage 2__: Problem and Solution Outline -> Outline what is the primary problem you are going to solve? How do you expect to solve it use AI/ML? What do you expect to build? What kind of data are you going to need to build it? Will you build a model or will you use an off-the-shelf model or library? Begin researching both requirements. Start your Deck Development -> Begin by creating a skeleton of the headers.

__The Weekend before__: Continue developing your project. Begin Market Research -> Start by asking who is your work going to benefit (these are your end-users and/or customers)? How are you going to get their input? Have an outreach plan; create surveys and begin setting up interviews. Start reaching out to folks you want to survey/interview. Do your Competitive Landscape Analysis -> Consider who else is solving this problem. What is left unsolved? Why? With this knowledge, refine your proposed solution. Begin your Tech Development -> Start by identifying and acquiring/creating datasets your need; outlining the model you will need to build, or exploring off-the-shelf model or libraries if that is the direction you want to go. Begin building the scaffolding code you will need to implement your solution. Rewatch the [past program winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9FyCODLflg&list=PLsSCYP2a9mZhAVJLVefDkOskkoW8m_UwH).

__Stage 3__; Finish your Competitive Landscape Analysis. Continue to Market Research work. Continue your Tech Development. Start your Deck Development if you have not yet. Begin outlining your Pitch: aka, what you will say during your **5-minute final project presentations**. 

__Stage 4__: Finalize the Tech Dev process. Share the **required one page description of your project** using the template provided. Continue all other threads of work. Keep practicing your Pitch.  

__Stage 5__: Finish your Market Research. Your Tech and Deck development should be near complete. Keep practicing your Pitch.  

__Stage 6__: Finish all threads of work. Keep practicing your Pitch.

__Last Stage__: Show up 15 minutes before the final presentation. Dress professionally. Present your team project at the Create-a-thon with confidence and pride. Celebrate successful program completion!
